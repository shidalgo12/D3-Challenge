# D3 

## Background

Sifted through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to create a scatter plot between Healthcare vs. Poverty.  Utilized both html and JavaScript to run analysis.

## Scatter Plot

Data pulled from .csv file by using the d3.csv function. Bootstrap CSS used to design elements of the HTML page and scatter plot including margins, fonts, markers, axes and labels. The following details applied to the scatter plot and fed into the html file using D3:

* Each state represented with circle elements.
* State abbreviations added into the circles.
* Axes and labels positioned to the left and bottom of the chart.
